        "[Phoenix](https://dtphx.org/) —the fifth most populous city in the United States—has worked hard to forge a balance between urbanism and rurality. It is a metropolis, but one whose main attraction may be the great outdoors nearby. As the city continues to grow, Phoenix has seen generations of people committed to staying here joined by a new influx of young people with a mind to quality food and drink. These newcomers tend to see the city as ripe for innovation, and in synthesis with the city’s appreciation for nature, have shaped a movement known as New Arizonan. Over the last few years, this emerging ethos has churned out its fair share of renowned brewers, chefs, and mixologists. In the midst of aggressively growing food and craft beer scenes, Phoenix coffee, too, has quietly begun to come into its own—feeling now more than ever like it’s on the verge of a boom. Below are a few cafes that have been at the forefront of the culture and which should be watched for new developments."
